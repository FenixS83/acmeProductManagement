  ## Goals

  My main goal in completing this project was to expand my knowledge base by helping me to learn and understand Angular.

  ## Motivation

  I've found that a lot of businesses use Angular for their websites.  I wanted to add to my marketable abilities by being able to add Angular to my developing skillset.

  ## Usage

  I intend to use this project to refer back to in the future when building other websites of similar layout and functionality.

  ## Installation
  
  npm -i  

  ## Test

  ng test

  ## Problems

  I had some difficulties getting my http client to acknowledge the server/json file that contains the product data.  As always, determination and a good thorough line-by-line checking eventually won out and I was able to over the complications.

  ## Visualization

  placeholder to add images or other media
